This repo powers my personal site.  
It also lies to you.

## What you’re looking at

- Build artifacts  
- Decoys  
- Old things  
- Fake things  
- Things that look important but aren’t  
- Things that look useless but aren’t

Pick wisely.

## Common mistakes

- “I’ll just read the source”
- “robots.txt always tells the truth”
- “This file name looks interesting”
- “That has to be the flag”
- “I’m done”

All wrong.

## About flags

Yes, they exist.  
Yes, there are fakes.  
Yes, they look real.

No, not everything that validates your ego will validate in the flag checker.
Cope accordingly.

## Pro tip

If GitHub was enough, this would be a writeup.

---

## Final warning

The site is honest.

Choose your attack surface.
